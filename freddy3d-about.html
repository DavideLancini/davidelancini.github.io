     <h2>The Freddy3D Project</h2>
     <span class="byline">My Journey</span>
    </header>
    <p>The first 3D printer I bought was a prusa clone kit by Geeetech.
     The machined had structural problems given by the wood assembly of the z
     axis.
     By studying engineering I learned how to overcame the problems with the
     frame.
     I came out with the idea to build a printer that can be deployed in an
     home environment and build a service that can give tecnical support.
     I couldn't use the prusa project so I decided to design a printer that can
     be easily used by normies.</p>
    <p>Modularity was a priority. I started to build my first prototype around
     6 main components.
     The first is the structure. I developed a cubic frame made by 2020
     standard aluminium extrusion. The joints were made firstly in ABS,
     designed to accomodate a stepper motor and the mechanism that connect to
     the other components.
     The second macro-component is the z-axis. This structrure accomodate the
     floating heated bed and is connected only to the main structure. This axis
     is not connected to the others and give the option to expandthe overall
     lenght of the machine to accomodate bigger prints.
     The x-axis and the y-axis are connected to the frame and to the extrusion
     block. This decision was made to reduce the dead width of the machine.
     This solution also remove the weight dependency on one axis to the other
     as they are both connected to the frame improving the rigidity.
     The extrusion block is vertically connected to the x-y joint. This
     facilitate the nozzle change as the entire block easily came out.
     The cable nest Is static for all the axis. The only moving cable is the
     one that need to reach the E-axis. It is parallel to the filament and
     moves only on 2 axis as the Z is inverted and is controlled from below the
     bed.
     The motion controller is positioned under the bed near the PSU.</p>
    <p>The software is custom and is... other page</p>
